"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like." (https://adventofcode.com/2019/about)

This was actually pretty fun... Quite hard at times but the whole intcode machine building was interesting.

Maybe I'll come back to it and finish it before the next one starts, once I'm done with university this year.
