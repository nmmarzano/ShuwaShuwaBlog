Literally just a dumb idea born from a dumb tweet.

"Stardew Valley mod that makes Abigail say nya at the end of every phrase".

Then I thought why not let's try and do it and maybe we'll learn something new along the way!!

Aside from finding the tools to pack/unpack .xnb files it's pretty straightforward, as it's just a matter of modifying text files... It seems replacing .xnb files is not particularly the safest method to mod Stardew Valley and there's another more flexible way of building mod packs though so I might look into that once I'm done rewriting the dialogue files.
