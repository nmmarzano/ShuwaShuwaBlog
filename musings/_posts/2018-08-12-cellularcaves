[CellularCaves.py (GitHub)](https://github.com/nmmarzano/CellularCaves.py)

Python implementation of a cellular automata-based algorithm for videogame-like cave generation.

If you imagine it as water and land you can even make continents and islands, playing around with the initial parameters... So simple yet flexible.
