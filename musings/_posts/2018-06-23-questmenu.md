Wow! Something that arose from an actual need to satisfy!

Pokémon Quest lets you cook up a bunch of different dishes depending on the ingredients you use, but there's a lot of guessing that can lead to a bunch of different outcomes. Pokémon Quest only offers vague hints and I was getting tired of looking up the different ways of making the dishes I wanted, so I thought to make a small program that takes my current ingredient quantities and outputs the dishes I can currently make according to [serebii.net](https://serebii.net/quest/cooking.shtml).

Apparently there's a sort of set of rules dictating which kinds of ingredients will make which dishes (ingredients are divided into a few categories) but it seems to be kinda loose in its definition or at least a bit more complex than at first sight, so I decided to just use serebii.net's list and make a Menu.

Maybe I'll investigate a little more into how ingredients of different categories affect the outputs and try to make something closer to the actual algorithm that chooses the kind of dish produced... QuestChef coming up soon?

Feeling people might use something like this, should I give it a GUI...
