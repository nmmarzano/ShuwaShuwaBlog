[CellularCaves.py (GitHub)](https://github.com/nmmarzano/CellularCaves.py)

Python implementation of a [cellular automata-based algorithm for videogame-like cave generation](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Cellular_Automata_Method_for_Generating_Random_Cave-Like_Levels).

If you imagine it as water and land you can even make continents and islands, playing around with the initial parameters... So simple yet flexible.
